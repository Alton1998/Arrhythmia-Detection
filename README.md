# Arrhythmia Detection

## Introduction

We will be using the [MIT data](https://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/database/html/mitdbdir/mitdbdir.htm) to train a model to detect Arrhythmias

## Tools And Frameworks
- [WFDB](https://wfdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## Approaches
### Machine Learning Approaches

We will be surveying the following algorithms in the is project:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Decision Tree
5. Support Vector Machines

### Deep Learning Approaches

We will be leveragin Supervised learning tasks:
